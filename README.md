      ```
   2. Install the necessary packages:

      npm install 
      ```
   3. For backend to run, mongodb url is needed, the .env file is also included in the repo for ease.
      > [!IMPORTANT]

Code Flow 
============

   * Implementation
     - Firstly, I worked on the backend as it will be easier to develop the frontend if i know the structure of the data I require. Then, I 
       created schema models and  API endpoints required by the frontend.
     - Adhering to the requirement provided, I had created 6 endpoints. Get to know the Enpoints [here](#api_endpoint)
     - Then, these endpoints are tested in postman and checked if the outputs are correct. After endpoints, The routes are configured in the    
       entry point of the backend.
     - For the clean code, and interacting with the backend, I chose to implement apiService as the middleware in frontend. This would contain 
       all the services and the backend endpoints to use in frontend.
     - The frontend has folders
              - assets - All the required images are present here;
              - components - Reusable components like CustomInput, Button are created to reduce duplicity of code.
              - screen - What the users will see, the Ui and layout is created here.
              - features - Features adhering to the requirement like checking of room, reserving the room, booking of room and creation of  
                           invoice logic are abstracted in this folder
              - store - I used Redux here to control the state of the count of the room reserved, removal
