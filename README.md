Installation
============

This project is divided into two parts: frontend and backend. Follow the instructions below to set up both.

### Backend

   1. Navigate to the backend directory:

      ```bash
      cd backend
      ```
   2. Install the necessary packages:
       ```bash
      npm install 
      ```
   3. For backend to run, mongodb url is needed, the .env file is also included in the repo for ease.

   4. Run the Backend: 
      ```bash
         npm run dev
      ```

### Frontend

   1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

      ```bash
      cd backend
      ```
   2. Install the necessary packages:
       ```bash
      npm install 
      ```
   4. Run the frontend: 
      ```bash
         npm run dev
      ```

Tech Stack
============

     * Frontend: React, Typescript, TailwindCSS, Redux Toolkit, Router
     * Backend: Node, Express, Mongoose, Mongodb

Code Flow 
============

   * Implementation
     - Firstly, I worked on the backend as it will be easier to develop the frontend if i know the structure of the data I require. Then, I 
       created schema models and  API endpoints required by the frontend.
       - After model and schema are done, I manually created some room data to populate the rooms that will be used for booking.
       - The image below shows the data present in mongodb
         ![](https://github.com/BajraYeJoon/Reserve/blob/main/frontend/src/assets/room.png)
         
     - Adhering to the requirement provided, I had created 6 endpoints. Get to know the Enpoints [here](#api_endpoint)
     - Then, these endpoints are tested in postman and checked if the outputs are correct. After endpoints, The routes are configured in the    
       entry point of the backend.
     - For the clean code, and interacting with the backend, I chose to implement apiService as the middleware in frontend. This would contain 
       all the services and the backend endpoints to use in frontend.
     - The frontend has folders
       - assets - All the required images are present here;
       - components - Reusable components like CustomInput, Button are created to reduce duplicity of code.
       - screen - What the users will see, the Ui and layout is created here.
       - features - Features adhering to the requirement like checking of room, reserving the room, booking of room and creation of  
                           invoice logic are abstracted in this folder
       - store - I used Redux here to control the state of the count of the reserved room, removal of the room from the cart and clearing the \                   cart after booked by the user.
      
     - For resolving the problem of conflicts within same date range or if any date exists on the booked room, I had used the mongodb `$or`             to check the conflicting date.
       ![](https://github.com/BajraYeJoon/Reserve/blob/main/frontend/src/assets/conflict.png)
    
     - I had also keep in mind about disabling the button until the fields for check in date, checkout date or any other field are either not           populated. Proper logging of error and message to user has been implmented with `try` and `catch` block.
     - For users to see if the room has already been booked on certain dates, I had made use of package like `react-big-calendar` and    
       implemented to show for which dates the room has been booked.
       
     - For multiple booking of room, instead of booking the room at first, I had made use of Reserving the room first which will be added into         the cart and if the user books 3 or more room, a discount of 5% is applied.
     - To generate the invoice, I had implemented `jsPDF` where the use can download the invoice of the booking.

FlowChart
============

  1. The image below show how I interact with the backend from the frontend through apiservice to make call to the api and get the different results.

  2. The image below is how i structure my frontend to connect with the backend and also different component to be reusable and modular.
